This repository contains an algorithm for Yoga Posture Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The implementation is based on TensorFlow and Keras.

## Project Structure

- `data`: Contains the training and testing datasets.
- `models`: Stores the trained model in H5 format.
- `src`: Source code for data preprocessing and yoga posture classification.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Other dependencies (specified in `requirements.txt`)

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
