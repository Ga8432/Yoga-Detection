# Yoga-Posture Classification

## Overview

This repository contains an algorithm for Yoga Posture Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The implementation is based on TensorFlow and Keras.

## Project Structure

- `data and model_file`: both are in google drive "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DcuG_1UQHvd5PD_qxB1puQL6GVOiUtNK?usp=sharing"
- `yoga_detection.ipynb`: contain whole process for n notebook format
- `models/test`:contain source code for testing dataa.
- `model/train`: Source code for data preprocessing and yoga posture classification.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
  

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
pip install Keras
pip install opencv-python
